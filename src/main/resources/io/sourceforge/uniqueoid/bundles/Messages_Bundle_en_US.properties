getStarted=Hi!\n\n\
This program is intended for search and deletion of duplicate files. \
In the context of this program, duplicates are considered to be files with the same content (i.e. files with coincide hash sums). \
Files must not be empty (size must be bigger than 0 bytes) and must be accessible. No other general restrictions.\n\n\
To begin choose files and folders to check and start new search. After it ends go to results panel.\
The selected file remains, the rest fall into deletion list. \
The template allows providing automatic selection in all fitting duplicate groups. \
Thus, there's no need to manually choose thousands of files. \
Also you may exclude files and folder (using template) from the duplicates list, if needed. \
In that case they can't fall into deletion list and won't disturb you anymore. \n\n\
Results may be saved and loaded. \
You can add results of the new search to the previous results \
(obviously, hash function must be the same).\n\n\
App allows deleting files only if one of the duplicates in group remains. \n\n\
REMEMBER, "files with the same content" are not always equal to \
"useless files". Think before deleting. There'll be no way back!\n\n\
Enjoy!
